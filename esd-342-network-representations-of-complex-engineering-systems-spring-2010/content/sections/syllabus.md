Course Outline
--------------

### What Students Will Do In This Course

*   Read the academic literature, including faculty notes and papers
*   Learn and practice some existing analytical methods, mainly network methods
*   Appreciate the wide range of domains where theory and methods have been applied
*   Critique existing theory and methods
*   Share knowledge and experience
*   Analyze some real systems in detail
*   Distill common concepts that emerge from theory and that apply to many kinds of systems

### Learning Objectives

*   Gain a research-level understanding of system architecture
*   Learn existing theoretical and analytical methods with particular emphasis on network analysis
*   Begin to develop some modeling skills of possible benefit in complex engineering systems
*   Compare systems in different domains (communication, engineering, organizations, infrastructures, and biology) and understand what influences their architectures
*   Apply/extend existing theory and modeling in case studies

Textbook and Readings
---------------------

Readings are an important part of the course, as they fuel discussions. The required text for this course is:

Watts, Duncan. _Six Degrees: The Science of a Connected Age_. New York, NY: W. W. Norton & Co., 2004. ISBN: 9780393325423.

In addition, we will assign additional research literature to read before class. Occasionally we will recommend optional background literature as well.
